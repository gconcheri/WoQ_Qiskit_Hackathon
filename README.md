# Qiskit Hackaton - LamaLab project

![Lamalab logo](images/lamalablogo.pdf)

This project realizes a three-staged enhancement of qiskit standard transpilation of quantum circuits. The stages act, respectively, at the pre-transpilation, transpilation, and post-transpilation level.

The team members who contributed to this project are: Damiano Aliverti-Piuri, Giacomo Amadore, Giovanni Concheri, Stefano Romboni, Giorgio Stucchi

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to the QISKIT hackaton organizers!

We adapted and took some code from [dlyongemallo](https://github.com/dlyongemallo/qiskit-zx-transpiler) and [ZX Calculus Projects](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx/blob/master/circuits/Fast/mod5_4_before), which should be mentioned when referncing the current repository.
