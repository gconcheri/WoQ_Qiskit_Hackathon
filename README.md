# Qiskit Hackaton - LamaLab project

(Make sure you check out our [LamaLab logo](https://github.com/giorgiostucchi/QiskitMunich/blob/main/lamalablogo.pdf)!)

This project realizes a three-staged enhancement of qiskit standard transpilation of quantum circuits. The stages act, respectively, at the pre-transpilation, transpilation, and post-transpilation level.

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to the QISKIT hackaton organizers!

We adapted and took some code from [dlyongemallo](https://github.com/dlyongemallo/qiskit-zx-transpiler) and [ZX Calculus Projects](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx/blob/master/circuits/Fast/mod5_4_before), which should be mentioned when referncing the current repository.
